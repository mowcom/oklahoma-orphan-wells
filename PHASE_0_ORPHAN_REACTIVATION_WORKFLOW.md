## 💰 Phase 0 Economics & ROI

### **Target Generation Costs:**
```
Desktop Analysis: $200/hr × 120 hrs = $24,000 (provided free per proposal)
Expected Output: ~100 ranked wells for Phase 1
Cost per qualified target: $240
```

### **Phase 0 Success Metrics:**
- **High/Surge Potential Wells**: Target 15-20 wells (15-20% of output)
- **Combined Success Rate**: 70%+ for reactivation viability
- **Phase 1 Conversion Rate**: 60% proceed to field survey
- **Ultimate Reactivation Rate**: 10-15% reach energized production

### **Revenue Model Validation:**
```
Target Wells Analyzed: 100
High/Surge Potential: 20 wells
Phase 1 Qualified: 12 wells (60%)
Phase 2 Passed: 8 wells (67%)
Phase 3 Acquired: 4 wells (50%)
Phase 4-5 Energized: 2 wells (50%)

Revenue per Energized Well: $0.10/MCF × avg 150 MCF/day × 365 days = $5,475/year
ROI Timeline: 3-5 years to recover $80k investment
```

## 📊 Phase 0 Targeting Workflow

### **Step 1: Oklahoma Orphan Identification**
```python
# Search criteria
orphan_status_codes = [21319, 21333, 21381, 2942, 42]
geographic_focus = "Oklahoma (State ID: 35)"
total_available = 554,298 wells
```

### **Step 2: Production History Screening**
```python
# Filter criteria  
minimum_production_months = 6
minimum_peak_production = 1,000 MCF/month
recent_activity_window = 24 months
analysis_timeframe = "2000-2024"
```

### **Step 3: Reactivation Scoring**
```python
# Scoring algorithm
consistent_production_bonus = +40 points
recent_surge_bonus = +30 points  
historical_peak_bonus = +20 points
production_decline_penalty = -10 to -30 points
dry_hole_elimination = 0 points (exclude)
```

### **Step 4: Business Categorization**
```python
# Output categories
high_priority_targets = score >= 85
solid_candidates = score 70-84
conditional_targets = score 50-69  
low_priority = score 20-49
excluded = score < 20
```
